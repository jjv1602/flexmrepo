# FLEXMREPO

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, please follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Here is what you need to be able to run Cal.com.

- Node.js (Version: >=18.x)
- PostgreSQL
- Npm _(recommended)_
### Technology Used
* `Database` - PostgreSQL
* Node.js
* Express
* React.js
* Vite
  
### Setup

1. Clone the repo into a public GitHub repository (or fork https://github.com/jjv1602/flexmrepo.git). 

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jjv1602/flexmrepo.git
   ```
2. Go to the project folder

   ```sh
   cd 
   ```

3. Install backend packages with npm

   ```sh
   npm i
   ```
4. Install frontend packages with npm
   ```sh
   cd frontend
   npm i
   ```
5. Set up your `.env` file

   - Duplicate `.env.example` to `.env`

6. Setup Node
   If your Node version does not meet the project's requirements as instructed by the docs, "nvm" (Node Version Manager) allows using Node at the version required by the project:

   ```sh
   nvm use
   ```

   You first might need to install the specific version and then use it:

   ```sh
   nvm install && nvm use
   ```

   You can install nvm from [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
